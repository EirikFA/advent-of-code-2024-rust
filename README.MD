- Day 6 part 2: Yes.. There might be something clever here, maybe model a graph and find how many different edges can be inserted to create a loop.. Sounds like a brute-force, no better than just trying to insert an obstacle in front of the guard for every position and checking for a cycle.. I am using Rust after all.. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
- Day 7 (part 2 specifically): Running in release and parallelizing the iterator takes it to about half a second, but maybe there's something clever to solve this faster than exponential time (about 3^9 or 3^10 operator combinations per equation with 850 equations)?
- Day 12 part 2: Something about counting corners.
- Day 17 part 2: Yes (no).
